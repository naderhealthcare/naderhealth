  <h2>Client Testimonial</h2>

  <div class="testimonial">
    <blockquote>
      <p>“She truly saved my life.”</p>

      <p>
        The following stories are how Cynthia helped me — both financially and medically — and why I can honestly say she saved my life.
        The first time she helped me was when my husband had a heart attack and required open-heart surgery at a major university hospital. We didn’t realize at the time that the hospital was out of our insurance network. Afterward, we were shocked to receive $10,000 in medical bills.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cynthia reviewed every bill and wrote a detailed letter on our behalf as my husband’s patient advocate. She explained that the transfer from the emergency room was an emergency and that the hospital-based physicians should have accepted our insurance under emergency care provisions. Because of her advocacy, the hospital waived $8,000 — leaving us responsible for only $2,000 instead of the full $10,000.
      </p>

      <p>
        The second time she helped me was during COVID, when I became severely ill with intense abdominal pain and couldn’t eat for days. My doctor only offered telehealth visits and ordered an unnecessary EGD (esophageal gastro-duodenal scoping) procedure that failed to reach the area of concern shown on my CAT scan. After two painful procedures, I was still in agony — and the doctor’s office stopped returning my calls.
      </p>

      <p>
        Desperate and scared, I turned to Cynthia again. She immediately recognized that I needed a second opinion and urged me to contact my niece, who is a Physician Assistant, for help getting a specialist referral. That led me to a surgeon who reviewed my scans the same evening, called me personally, and saw me the next day.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cynthia came with me to that appointment for support. The surgeon quickly saw what others had missed — the previous procedures could never have reached the area shown on the CAT scan. Within days, I had surgery, and they discovered cancer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because of Cynthia’s quick thinking, knowledge, and determination, my cancer was caught and treated in time. I truly believe she saved my life.
